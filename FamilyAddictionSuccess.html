										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">	
											Frankly, I’m disappointed. I had a deep, blunt, and honest discussion with each member of my family over this past Christmas break. I explained to each of them, how tired I am…
										</p>
										<ul style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
											<li>Of holding the Father, Son, Husband, and Brother role in our family.</li>
											<li>Of feeling like I am the only thing holding our family together.</li>
											<li>Of being the mediator between each of their arguments.</li>
											<li>That my parent’s divorce has been taking over 6 years to settle.</li>
											<li>That my parents are spending thousands of dollars on lawyer and court fees.</li>
										</ul>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
											I was honest with my feelings and worries, truly hoping they would take them to heart. It’s been 3 months since those meetings, and it seems like the only change from them has been negative or completely absent.
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">I pushed my Sister to be adventurous in her lifestyle, place of living, and relationships with others. I suggested for my Mom to explore a new career path and fight for what she deserves. I asked for my Dad to understand the challenges I face from his decisions and actions. I asked for them all to take a leap of faith in their lives. I asked for them to trust me.
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">Addiction runs in our family; Alcoholism has affected too many members of my family, but it isn’t the only form of addiction we have suffered from. Whether it be addiction to liquor, weed, routine, or even simplicity and comfort, it has affected each of us, including myself. When I went home for the Christmas break, I was addicted to marijuana edibles. They helped me slow down my constantly running mind, while simultaneously numbing my non-physical pain. 3 months ago, after having said honest discussion with my family members, I flushed the rest of my edibles down the toilet. I haven’t thought of them since. I suggested for my family members to make a similar change, to stop using drugs and alcohol as a crutch. After phone calls with my Mom, Dad, and Sister these past few days, I have learned drugs and alcohol are still part of their weekly and even daily routines.
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">Hearing this hurts my heart more than I ever thought was possible, especially when I consider how fantastic my last 3 months have been.
										</p>
										<ul style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
											<li>I am halfway through my third year of software engineering and I know this is the career for me. I am loving many of my courses and my grades have never been higher. I have received over $5000 in scholarships over just the past 2 semesters purely from my academic success and merit.
											</li>
											<li>I am now a part owner of my own Startup, where I am personally coding and creating our app. I spend my days doing schoolwork, and nights building our product, which we are aiming to present to investors before the end of this summer.
											</li>
											<li>I have taught myself to invest and I have been managing my money better than I ever thought I could. I have recently been successful in my investments, which makes me feel proud and capable.</li>
											<li>I have made some of the most incredible friends over the last 2 months, a group of fellow engineers who I know will always have my back. They push me to be my best self, and because of them I am motivated about my education, working out 5 days a week, and smiling more than I ever have before.</li>
											<li>My existing friends have continued to make me feel loved and supported. I am associated with a diverse group of individuals who I am proud to show off. I have gone to events, had educated discussions, and grown with them in ways I never thought was possible.
											</li>
											<li>I have learned that if there is something I want in life, I need to go get it.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">I know I am successful; These past 3 months have been the best in my life; however, I continually hear friends and family using covid as an excuse to not seek out new opportunities. Something which doesn’t make sense to me, and my list above proves my point. I understand covid lockdowns have made opportunities difficult to find, and with consistent obstacles. All it took for me was to keep looking and fight through whatever got in my way.
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">I am working as hard as I possibly can to reach my ideals of success, yet phoning home to my family makes me sad. I feel like I am leaving them behind, and there is nothing I can do about it anymore. It doesn’t matter if I become the most rich and successful person ever, all I want is for my family members to trust me, be happy, and take some leaps of faith.</p>
