										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">	
											Over this past easter break, I planned to go on a walk with my father, to confront him about all the disappointments I had regarding my upbringing. Unfortunately, an in-person discussion was impractical due to covid restrictions, and to be frank, it would have been a one-sided conversation anyways. There is nothing I wanted my father to say or do. I simply wanted him to listen and understand how I feel, thus, here we are.
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">	
											There is a significant difference between a Dad and a Provider. A Provider has the means and abilities to support a daughter and/or son financially and physically, to put food on the table and buy school supplies. A Dad, while usually meeting these requirements as well, also provides encouragement and support, while simultaneously teaching you lessons, so you don’t have to learn them the hard way. A Dad is always a Provider, but a Provider is not always a Dad.
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">	
											There are a lot of lessons I had to learn on my own. Lessons most would expect a dad to teach to their son. There are plenty of little lessons to pick from, however the two most fundamental for myself were how to shave and tie a tie. I had to essentially teach myself how to shave, with some advice from my Mom. As a Young boy with Alopecia, I had to shave quite often to prevent unattractive hair growth. Every nick, cut, and scratch on my head was a tiny lesson on how to properly obtain a smooth scalp. This is what I would call learning the hard way. Similarly with tying a tie, I watched YouTube videos before every formal event or picture day for years to get the perfect knot around my neck. I did so because whenever I asked for assistance, my Father would grab the tie, tie the knot quickly around his own neck, before handing it to me to wear with zero instruction. 
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">	
											I was never properly taught how to respect women. It is without a doubt the most significant lesson I never had a scheduled lecture for. Respecting Women 101 isn’t a class in high school, and it most certainly isn’t going to be taught to you from other boys your age. When there is little to no respect between a man and his wife at home, the gap of knowledge is evident in any young boy. 
										</p>
										<ul style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
											<li>Young Cameron would listen to his Mom and Sister being disrespected, whether over the dinner table, or during screaming matches as he hid upstairs in his room.</li>
											<li>Young Cameron would listen and watch his Father make flirtatious, and extremely offside, comments to waitresses and bartenders while he ate his wings and watched the hockey game across the table. Both before and after his parents’ divorce.</li>
											<li>Young Cameron would fill in as goalie for his Father’s beer league team and hear locker room talk firsthand from primarily old single men.</li>
											<li>Young Cameron sat in the living room as his Mom opened his Father’s laptop to see dozens of hateful and disrespectful emails about her.</li>
											<li>Young Cameron received nothing but love from his Mom, and he was tired of being told of her apparent downfalls from his Father’s friends.</li>
											<li>Young Cameron was never taught how to talk, interact, respect, or be with a woman in any form by his Father.</li>
										</ul>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
											I had to learn the hard way when it came to interacting with women. During high school I repeatedly made mistakes in multiple forms during parties or other social interactions. I had no advice or prior knowledge, plus with few responsible friends at the time, I had nobody to hold me accountable. I am disappointed in my previous younger self, so I took classes, listened to solid advice, and gained experienced, including long term relationships, that have allowed for me, to prove to myself, that I no longer lack this essential knowledge.
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
											The one topic my Father did teach me a great deal about was sports. I always loved sports and continue to, to this day. However, any interests I had which did not fall into the realm of sports, or my Father’s interests, were supressed and disregarded. 
										</p>
										<ul style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
											<li>My Father told me he would hit me if I attempted to get my motorcycle license.</li>
											<li>My Father and his girlfriend told me I would be shot if I went into the arts.</li>
											<li>My Father pushed me into the most esteemed university program possible just so he could brag about it to his friends.</li>
										</ul>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
											I loved playing video games growing up, they gave me means to escape during even the most difficult of days. When there was fighting or yelling coming from the family room for the third time that day, being able to put on a headset, grab a controller, and become a Jedi, a race car driver, or a marine was liberating. I just wished my Dad would’ve sat down, and picked up the controller with me.
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
											I was afraid of my Father for a lot of my childhood. He was always good to me, but he never treated my Mom or Sister to the level of respect I deemed fair. I was afraid that if I were not to appease him, he would treat me the same way as the women in our family. I know I am putting a lot of fault on my Father, but I know he did everything he could to make me happy. I know my grandfather wasn’t the best role model for him as well. I love my Dad; He means the world to me and I know if I ever need him, he will run across the world to assist. However, I have been giving him too much slack for too long, just having to hold your own Dad accountable is a task I never wish on any daughter or son. A task I never wanted or could accomplish.
