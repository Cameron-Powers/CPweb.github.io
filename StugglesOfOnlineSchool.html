						Working from home sounds great for everyone, especially household pets, however now that we begin to come full circle on a year of 
						social distanced work and schooling, the change in lifestyles for many has revealed modern day obstacles. When Covid-19 first came 
						to Ottawa in full force, I was working full time at the House of Commons in a co-op position. The sudden change from the consistent 
						8-4pm schedule to really no schedule at all was unexpected but quite honestly, welcomed. At first it seemed like a win-win, I could 
						continue working full time while avoiding the early morning train rides, walking in the snow to work, and of course could remain safe 
						and socially distanced. However, there was a large loss that came with this transition to a work from home setup, and it was my 
						lifestyle.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
						I love organization, and part of that is a consistent routine of healthy habits. While working that co-op job, I would leave work and 
						head straight to the gym every day after work, I would spend more time walking and moving both between home and work, as well as back 
						and forth to meetings. After work, I had every evening available to spend time with friends, go out to events, and work on myself 
						before waking up at 7am and doing it all again the next day. Weekends felt like an opportunity to live, were I had two full free days 
						for me to seize and enjoy. However, as covid strengthened its grip on our society, more and more of these daily habits were difficult 
						to accomplish, and more importantly, felt meaningless to actively complete. 
					</p>
					<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
						University classes before covid required a plan and schedule, you had to be at the right place at the right time while simultaneously 
						managing sleep, exercise, food, and other typical daily tasks. Seems like any normal day, covid or not, but let me take you through it 
						step by step. You have a morning class at 8:30am, most people don’t prefer such early classes, but I enjoyed how they forced me to start 
						my day early. Prior to covid, an 8:30am class would require a 7:30am wake up, allowing for time to get ready, properly dress myself, eat 
						a good breakfast, before a 10 minute or so walk to class. By 8:30, I have already accomplished a healthy morning routine and my professor 
						hasn’t even begun teaching. Conversely, having an 8:30am online lecture means I can wake up at 8:29am, roll out of bed, and sit down for 
						my lecture without even putting on a proper pair of pants. Sure, I may have gotten an extra hour of sleep which is a win in most people’s 
						books, but the reality is that I went to bed at least an hour later than I would have for an in-person class. Let’s take the same example 
						but make it an 11am class, if it was in person, I could sleep in a bit but would still have to wake up earlier to complete my morning 
						routine. On the contrary, an online class would have me rolling out of bed minutes before class and spending half the class eating rather 
						than being fully attentive.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
						This issue may seem small to start, but after weeks, months, and almost 10 university courses later, the affects add up. There is simple 
						no need for students to be their best self. I would like to interject and remind the reader that this is my personal experience, for some, 
						online classes enabled them to be there best self as they don’t need to focus on other daily schedules or other distractions. Perhaps 
						online classes save others significant time and money on transit or car fees, but what I do know is that every student is having to sit 
						down and stick their face in front of a screen for hours a week in order to learn, which doesn’t fit everyone’s learning styles. This is 
						all assuming the lectures are worth going to. With many being recorded and uploaded for later viewing, what’s the difference learning 
						the material at 10am than 1pm? 6pm? 11pm?
					</p>
					<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
						Online schooling simply provides the course material without the lifestyle that comes with university. Many students, like myself, work 
						a part time job on the side, but aside from work, there is nowhere else to go. No reason to dress up or keep in shape, and very little 
						to look forward to in the future. Days turn into weeks, and weeks turn into months. Everyday feels the same, especially as someone with 
						the same work schedule each week, I feel like I am living the same week over and over again. Prior to covid, finishing a midterm or 
						assignment meant I could go to a party that night, or spend time doing what you want. Shifting to online classes switches this but 
						without the social aspect. I can spend all day doing whatever I want as long as I complete my schoolwork at some point before the 
						deadline. There is no need to schedule or allocate time to work on an assignment.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
						Online school boils down to discipline and motivation. From the start, the biggest difference between high school and university is 
						motivating and holding yourself accountable to attend class, study, and complete assignments. However, after moving online, finding 
						the motivation just to attend class can be difficult, let alone live a healthy and proper lifestyle simultaneously. I feel into this 
						hole, to my credit I have been personally successful in all of my online classes but finding the motivation to maintain a proper sleep 
						schedule, work out, or even put on a proper pair of pants was lacking. I was fully aware of the benefits to maintain the healthy 
						lifestyle I already built, but achieving it felt meaningless. As the winter months roll in and the cold forces everyone indoors, 
						achieving and maintaining healthy habits and lifestyles will be necessary to avoid stagnation and combat the possibility of developing 
						seasonally depression. I have begun forcing myself to wake up earlier, getting properly dressed, and working out regularly. Now for the 
						ever so easy part, holding myself accountable.
