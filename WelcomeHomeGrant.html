											We ate pasta, had a few beers, and watched American Pie. It was a night to remember.
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
											Tomorrow Grant leaves to head up north to be a forest firefighter for the summer, quite the admirable profession, not to mention badass. The guy literally fights fire with fire. I see a lot of myself in Grant, not because he is a firefighter and I was in a house fire, but because I can relate to him. I was once quite the lost puppy, adventuring off into the real world looking for a home. Grant noted this was the longest he had lived in one place, which was for a grand total of only 5 months, plus or minus a few days. Although I can’t say the same, 205 Henderson is the first place where calling it a home actually feels right. For the longest time I always felt like I just wanted to go home. It wasn’t a state of mind fogging up my brain, or a gut feeling, but rather an anxious pit located deep in my chest. I could be in my childhood bedroom, on campus studying, or deep in the wilderness, and this ambiguous void would be ever present regardless of my physical location.
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">Andy, Matt, Myself, and the rest of the boys, all gave Grant a tough time at first, and it was obvious some of which, didn’t mesh well with him from the get-go, for fair, but misunderstood reasons. It was tough to hear anyone speak ill of Grant, and honestly, I caught myself doing the same from time to time. My faults were made fun of quite often behind my back growing up. Whether it be people whispering about my bald head or for making a mistake, I always knew it was happening, but there is little one can do to prevent negative closed-door discussions about themselves. Thus, I worked hard to nudge the boys into diverting their energy towards teaching and being informative, rather than making fun of him. Grant also tended to exaggerate or make suspicious claims which were difficult to accept their validity. Being surrounded by several older guys who are observative and shell out criticism like a fully loaded machine gun, would assist anyone to bend back their crooked habits.
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">From what Grant opened up to me about, it’s obvious he had a difficult upbringing, and in doing so, he mentioned to me that nobody can ever relate to his struggles and adversities. I statement I disagree with. Although I will save my life story for my memoir, my childhood had its fair share of up and downs as well. I may be out on a whim here by attempting to state what I can relate to, but I know what it’s like to feel alienated, alone, and like the world is crumbling around me and I can’t work any harder to stop it.
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">The boys rallied around Grant and it warms my heart. Matt has turned from being a hard noosed judge who would literally say ‘no’ every time Grant took a step out of his room, to the ultimate Dad. Including everything from helping his ‘son’ with his schoolwork, driving him around, and even cooking him kraft dinner while Grant wrote his exams. Andy fit well into the fun, yet experienced, bigger brother role. Regardless of how badly Andy would be getting beat, or the amount of trash talk Grant threw his way, Andy would always happily play video games with him. Upon getting crushed in chel by Grant, Andy would still gladly turn the corner and teach him a few lessons about cooking. This past four months has been a movie level story line, especially including the prominent character development.

                                        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">	
											From the moment I meet Grant I knew there was a lot under that thick skin of his. I also knew it would take time for him to open up on his own accord, not for me to pry into his personal life. All it would take is some time and listening with both my ears and eyes. Paying attention to both verbal and non-verbal inclinations is essential to understand a person. I wish the best to Grant, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Some advice for the young man.
