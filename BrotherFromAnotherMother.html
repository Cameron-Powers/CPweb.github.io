                                            I’ve been listening to a lot of Denzel Curry’s music lately. One of his recent songs is called “RICKY”, where Denzel dives into his past to recognize the people, and environment, which influenced his life. In the chorus of the song, Denzel shares advice given to him by his father,
                                        </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
											My daddy said, “Trust no man but your brothers <br>And never leave your day ones in the gutter”<br>My daddy said, “Treat young girls like your mother”<br>...
										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
                                            My only true sibling is my sister, however growing up I quite literally had a brother from another mother, Andrew Lindsay. We did everything from playing hockey, video games, and camping together. Saturday night sleepovers before church on Sunday morning felt like a weekly occurrence. 										
                                        </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
                                            As much as I enjoy reminiscing about fond childhood memories, I feel like I left my day one in the gutter. Unfortunately, I did not receive the same fatherly advice Denzel refers to in his lyrics, but I won’t dive too deep into it as I explained majority of it in my <a href="DadVsProvider.html">Dad vs Provider article</a>. 										
                                        </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
                                            Regardless, I am not proud of the boy I was in high school for a variety of reasons. Growing up, I always left it up to Andrew to ask me to play video games, go golfing, or hangout, as I rarely made the effort to reach out to him. Andrew and I never went to the same schools, and quite often I used this fact to validate why I was so distant, when in reality, it was my own neglect and lethargy.										
                                        </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
                                            I wasn’t a good guy in high school. To be frank, I never learned to treat young women like my mother. I all too often, made women feel uncomfortable around me and disrespected their bodies and online presence. During majority of these instances, I was blackout drunk, which resulted in me losing control of my restraint, respect, and morals. 										
                                        </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
                                            During this moment in my life, I was suffering through an abundance of trauma due to my family situation, in which I medicated with alcohol, a common pattern in my family tree. Another loaded sentence which I further explained in my  <a href="FamilyAddictionSuccess.html">Family, Addiction, and Success article</a>. 										
                                        </p>
                                        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
                                            Lack of memory is a side effect of being blackout, which left me unaware and confused to the negative attitude my peers had towards me the next morning. I wish I had someone there to hold me accountable for my actions, and in those moments, there lies regret for having pushed Andrew away. I was ashamed of myself, that’s the honest truth, however, my ego prevented me from accepting, or doing anything about it.
                                        </p>
                                        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
                                            I think I have made it obvious I am not proud of my past self. Cam today would not even want to associate himself with high school Cameron, let alone anyone else. Regardless of my adolescent flaws, Andrew always kept up with me, and treated me like a brother. For this reason, and countless others, Andrew has continued to impress me. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
                                            His friendly and warm personality makes him approachable, and he can light up any room with his smile and laughter. Alongside his calm temperament and low key, yet charming, charisma, there is a strong business mind which can identify value in remote items. Whether it be sneakers, rookie basketball cards, or apparel, Andrew is like a pirate when it comes to looking for treasure. In conjunction with his natural business senses, he can develop a following on social media from scratch, helping me, and many others, stay informed about everything hype. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
                                            I’m sorry for letting you down Andrew, I’m forever thankful to have you in my life. The journey I’ve taken has had its rocky moments but taught me lessons I would not have learned anywhere else. I love you brother, happy 21st birthday, and I hope to see you soon.
