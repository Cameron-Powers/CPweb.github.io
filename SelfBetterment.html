										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">	
										Change is intimidating; many people fear it. Whether it is dreading their next birthday, for the fear of growing up, or being afraid to move out due to the uncertainty that is the outside world, change affects us all.                                         </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
										Whether you are ready or not, change is going to catch up with everyone one of us one way or another, it is simply inevitable. Being that change is such a certainty, why waste energy trying to avoid it?										</p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
										I enjoy regular change, and I’m quite used to it. Although I am still nervous or anxious, I know change means I will be spending more time in discomfort or uncertainty, the best place to learn. When there is change, sometimes everything works out exactly as planned, yet quite often, I fail; That’s Life, but the important part is I learned a lesson.                                          </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
										Change reminds me to appreciate the present, whether it be a wild night, or a busy day of work, I stop and reflect on what I have enjoyed and learned. I know that none of it is here to stay, so might as well make the most of every occasion while I’m here.                                        </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
										Being a friend was the most important lesson I ever learned. It is difficult to open up when being as anxious or timid as myself, yet sharing yourself with other just takes time and effort. In the past, I was reluctant to put in the work as I always found it so much easier on my own. I could do what I want, when I wanted, with zero worries about judgement.                                        </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
										Upon moving out, I experimented with multiple groups and, and for years, I never felt like I was around people who were similar to me. Recently that has changed, and I have done my best to talk about myself and share who I am with them.                                         </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
										I have always been afraid of being judged, yet when I am around my friends, judgement doesn’t even exist. Whether it be working out, playing basketball, or even beer pong, nobody cares how well I do, they are just happy to have me there.                                         </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
										Post Covid life has me excited. There are the obvious reasons of course, such as being able to go to bars and gyms, but those aren’t what I am looking forward to most. Cameron is gone and Cam is ready. The guy who is fit, successful, has great friends, and a solid social web, aspects that would make my younger self proud.                                         </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
										I’ve been using Covid to my advantage to work on myself as much as possible when stuck indoors. That includes personal projects such as writing, where I use it as a creative outlet to create blogs, sketch comedy scripts, and stand-up lines.                                         </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
										I have also been working out five times a week for almost 5 months now which is without a doubt the longest I’ve been able to keep up a regular gym schedule. I am in the best shape of my life and have no plans on stopping.                                         </p>
										<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
										Finally, I am now surrounded with great friends who make me smile, which I am forever thankful for. I feel like I am on the pinnacle of my success and cannot wait to see where my never-ending self-betterment attitude takes me.                                        </p>
