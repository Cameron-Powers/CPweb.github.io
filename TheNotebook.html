						I momentarily begin to get up and unbox my new keyboard, before forcing myself to return to my seat and begin tapping the keys on my perfectly fine laptop. Once again, I am busy attempting to delay the inevitable which I seem too afraid to face. An adversity that is so substantial, it shakes me to my core whenever I look in its direction. However, surprisingly enough, I couldn’t have a bigger smile on my face. I want to write more, not just code and its fancy functions and commands, but the words that run through my head when I can’t sleep, the same ones that I feel in my heart. For some reason, I’ve always been too afraid to start.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
						The more and more I type, ideas begin rushing through my mind like salmon going upstream. Coming out of nowhere before jumping over a current and out of my head. I need to jot them down, but I can’t put them into this word doc I am using now, it just feels too official; And frankly, my typing speed can’t keep up. I need that notebook. It’s matte blue, the perfect medium size, conveniently blank, and sitting around here somewhere… I glance down to my right and see my desk cabinet, it’s gotta be in there, where else could it be? I lean over my chair and fling open the cabinet door, “It’s gotta be right out front”, I ambitiously say to myself. Nonetheless, the notebook doesn’t appear like the matte blue gem I thought it would. I begin to panic as more salmon continue to jump upstream, I need to write all this down! I’ve always liked the idea of writing, I keep a list of funny sketch ideas on my phone, I crushed English classes in high school, and love the art of stand-up comedy. I need to stop typing and find this notebook. iPhone flashlight on.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
						As I shine a light into the deep depths of my desk cabinet like a miner with their headlamp, I come to the realization that this sleek medium sized matte blue gem of a notebook is nowhere to be found. There is no way it’s in any other place at home than this cabinet and I just moved into another place of my own and I know the notebook wasn’t packed. C r a p. Alas, I will begin a search and rescue when the sun is up, as it is too early in the morning to venture into the darkness of my home. Plus, I wouldn’t want to wake the sleeping monsters within, or our pets. For now, the notebook is MIA. So, I found a different notebook. Easy enough, but I don’t have the same passion for this one as the last. It was the notebook I filled with information while working at a co-op position the first summer after university.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
						I grab a pen and start writing down my idea, one down, and then another!... and I stop. This pen is dreadful. A quick pitstop into the mug on my desk and select a different one. This pen is also from everyone’s favourite office supply store, but I spent an extra few dollars on it, so you know it’s good.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;text-indent:2cm;">
						Would you look at that, I am busy delaying the inevitable again. I have all these ideas to write and create yet I’ve been frantically typing about a notebook and my choice of pens instead. I recently made vast realizations in my life I never knew about or was choosing to turn a blind eye on. As I begin to build myself and my own career, I intend to simultaneously write about both my nonsensical past, eager present, and future of endless possibilities. I will be honest with whatever I write, as I believe I am in the eye of the storm. I don’t know how to get out, but I know where I am, I understand what came before, and what I must do to get out. Now all I got to do is start walking.
					</p>

					<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-size: 12px;">
						PS: I’ve decided to title this, “The Notebook”, like the movie with Ryan Gosling, kinda cheesy and cliché, plus it’s never good to be in competition with hot and steamy Gosling within someone’s head; Yet I find it fitting.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-size: 12px">
						PPS: I found the notebook! It was in my backpack as I took it out of my desk cabinet only a few days prior to the first draft. I guess that’s what happens when you start writing at 1 in the morning.
